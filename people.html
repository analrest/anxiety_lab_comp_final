                <h3> Emily Juel, M.A (she/her) </h3>
                <p> Emily Juel is a second-year doctoral student in the Clinical Psychology program. She grew up in Chapel Hill and earned her B.S. in Psychology and Sociology from Davidson College in 2021. After graduation, she worked as a postgraduate associate at the Yale Child Study Center in the Anxiety and Mood Disorders Program. Her work supported two federally funded clinical trials: one assessing the efficacy of a parent-based approach to reduce family accommodation in childhood anxiety disorders, and another examining a computer-based treatment for adolescents with social anxiety.
                    Emilyâ€™s current research examines how parental accommodation behaviors contribute to the maintenance of anxiety and related disorders in young adults. She is particularly interested in how smartphone use, including family tracking apps and social media, may reinforce these patterns.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My research and clinical interests focus on anxiety and related disorders (including obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]) and I mentor and train UNC clinical psychology graduate students in these areas. I also teach graduate and undergraduate courses at UNC. Working with many wonderful students and collaborators, I have published over 300 research articles, book chapters, encyclopedia entries, and books on anxiety, OCD, and related topics.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I joined the Clinical Psychology faculty at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2006 and am currently Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience and Director of the Clinical PhD Training Program. My previous positions include Associate Chair of the UNC Psychology and Neuroscience Department (2007-2017), Assistant/Associate Professor at the Mayo Clinic and Mayo School of Medicine (2000-2006), and Instructor at the University of Pennsylvania (1999-2000).</p>

            <p id="research-intro-line">Our lab is  conducting research in the following areas:</p>
            <h3>Outcome and mechanisms of exposure therapy</h3>
            <p>We are interested in how to improve the efficacy of exposure therapy 
                for anxiety and OCD. Current studies focus on the therapeutic relationship, 
                homework adherence, and ways of enhancing exposure therapy using an ACT and 
                inhibitory learning approaches.</p>
            <h3>Cognitive biases and other factors in OCD and other anxiety-related problems</h3>
            <p>We are interested in the cognitive biases and other factors that maintain OCD and 
                other related problems and have published numerous studies on these topics. 
                A recent study examined biases contributing to OCD symptoms during COVID-19. 
                Another looked at how perceptions of uncertainty and risk contribute to the 
                perception of threat in common situations.  Some of our current studies examine 
                the relationship between racial discrimination and OCD symptoms, sleep and OCD 
                symptoms, the overlap between PTSD and OCD, the role of guilt in OCD and anxiety, 
                and possible associations between OCD and dissociation experiences.</p>

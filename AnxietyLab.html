        <p>
            Anxiety disorders are the most common type of psychological problems, affecting up to 25% of adults at some point in their lives. Individuals with anxiety problems fear various situations, leading to avoidance or severe discomfort. In some instances, the person cannot have healthy relationships, function at work/school, or enjoy social and leisure time. Anxiety disorders are also related to medical problems. Our current understanding of anxiety disorders is getting better, yet there is much work to be done; and although effective treatments exist for anxiety disorders, there is much room for improvement. <br>The Anxiety Lab brings together faculty, graduate students, post-baccalaureate trainees, and undergraduates interested in studying the nature and treatment of clinical anxiety (and related) problems. We focus on understanding the factors that lead to these problems, the nature and assessment of anxiety symptoms, and how the treatment of clinical anxiety can be improved. We also disseminate our work through research publications and conference presentations, as well as through workshops and other training opportunities. Our work focuses on OCD, health anxiety, phobias, social anxiety, and panic attacks
